Description:
This site is a weather dashboard, displaying the current weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast in a city of the user's choice. In addition to displying the weather info, the site will save the user's choice of city to local storage, so that when they return they can select the city from a list of previously-searched cities. 

Technology:
The weather data is pulled from two APIs from Openweathermap.org. Using JavaScript, the site displays the data through dynamically-updated elements and displays a dynamic list of buttons to re-view cities. 

UV Index:
The site does not display the UV Index, although this was in the user story. This was due to ongoing problems with the API keys. The application would accept my API keys for the current conditions but not the forecast, causing the original delay in submission. After four days the same keys suddenly started working. But on the API needed to pull the UV info, no keys are being accepted as valid. I understand points will be docked for that not being included, but at this point I need to move on from this assignment and give my focus to the new material.
